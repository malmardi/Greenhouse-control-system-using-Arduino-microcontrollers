# Greenhouse-control-system-using-Arduino-microcontrollers
**Description:**
This project was implemented in the advanced embedded systems course in Spring/2012 at the American University of Sharjah (AUS).

Project objectives: build a distributed greenhouse control system that has the following functionalities

 - Monitoring the actual measurements ( temp , humidity , Light) in GUI.
 - Remotely turn ON/OFF the cooler, artificial light, and water valve. 
 - Control the water valves ,cooler, and light based on time schedules.
 - Control the water valves ,cooler, and light based on given thresholds.
